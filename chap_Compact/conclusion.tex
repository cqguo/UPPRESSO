\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper presents \usso, an untraceable and unlinkable privacy-preserving SSO system for protecting a user's online profile across RPs against both a curious IdP and colluding RPs.
We propose an identity-transformation approach for privacy-preserving SSO and design algorithms that satisfy the requirements, where (\emph{a}) $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{RP}}$ protects an RP's identity from the curious IdP, (\emph{b}) $\mathcal{F}_{PID_{U}}$ prevents colluding RPs from linking a user across different RPs, and (\emph{c}) $\mathcal{F}_{Acct}$ enables an RP to derive a permanent account for a user in multiple logins. These identity transformations are integrated into the widely-adopted OIDC protocol, maintaining user convenience and security guarantees of SSO services. Our experimental evaluations of the \usso\ prototype demonstrate its efficiency, with an average login taking 174 ms when the IdP, the visited RP, and user agents are deployed in a virtual private cloud, or 421 ms when a user visits remotely.
