\section*{Ethics Considerations}
This work proposes a single sign-on (SSO) protocol, analyzes its properties of security and privacy,
    implements the prototype system,
    and experimentally evaluates the prototype in isolated environments.
Thus, there is no necessary ethical issue on this work.

\section*{Compliance with the Open Science Policy}
The prototype system of \usso\ is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/uppresso/}, publicly accessible.
