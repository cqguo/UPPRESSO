\section*{Ethics Considerations}
This work proposes a privacy-preserving SSO protocol, analyzes its properties of security and privacy,
    implements the prototype system,
    and experimentally evaluates the prototype in isolated settings.
Thus, there is no necessary ethical issue.

\section*{Compliance with the Open Science Policy}
The prototype system of \usso\ is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/uppresso/}, publicly accessible.
It includes source codes for IdP servers and an RP SDK.
