\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Single sign-on (SSO) allows a user to maintain only the credential at an identity provider (IdP) to log into multiple relying parties (RPs).
However, SSO introduces privacy threats, as ({\em a}) a curious IdP could potentially track a user's visits to all RPs, and ({\em b}) colluding RPs could learn a user's online profile by linking her identities across these RPs.
This paper presents a privacy-preserving SSO protocol, called \usso, to protect an honest user's online profile against (\emph{a}) an honest-but-curious IdP and (\emph{b}) malicious RPs and users who could collude.
\usso\ proposes an identity-transformation approach to generate untraceable \emph{ephemeral pseudo-identities} for an RP and a user (denoted as $PID_{RP}$ and $PID_U$, respectively) from which the target RP derives a \emph{permanent account} for the user (denoted as $Acct$), while the transformations provide unlinkability.
This approach protects the unique identities of the user and the RPs that she requests to log into while working compatibly with SSO services and satisfying all the security requirements.
%Compared with existing SSO protocols, \usso\ is among the first to prevent both types of privacy threats. Compared with existing privacy-preserving identity federation schemes, \usso\ supports all the desired SSO features while providing sufficient privacy protections.  % 省去，放到Introduction即可
% \usso\ proposes a novel identity-transformation approach. In each SSO login, an \emph{ephemeral pseudo-identity} of an RP, denoted as $PID_{RP}$, is negotiated between a user and the RP. $PID_{RP}$ is sent to the IdP and designated in the identity token, so that the IdP is not aware of the visited RP.
% The IdP then uses $PID_{RP}$ to transform the user's permanent identity $ID_U$, into an ephemeral user pseudo-identity $PID_U$, in the token.
% On receiving the identity token, %%%% the RP just waits for it.
% the RP transforms $PID_U$ into a \emph{permanent account} of the user, denoted as $Acct$. Given a user, the account at each RP is unique and different from $ID_U$, %%%% for different users, the accounts may be the same.
%so colluding RPs cannot link a user's identities across RPs.
We have built a prototype of \usso\ on top of MITREid Connect, an open-source SSO system. The extensive evaluations show that it fulfills the security and privacy requirements of SSO
while introducing reasonable overheads.
