\section*{Open Science}
The prototype system of \usso\ has been open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/uppresso/}, publicly accessible.
It includes source codes of the IdP server and an RP,
    and a COTS browser works as the user agent in \usso.

We experimentally compared \usso\ with MITREid Connect v1.3.3 which is  open-sourced
 at \url{https://github.com/mitreid-connect}
    and SPRESSO available at \url{https://github.com/sec-stuttgart/spresso}.

If this manuscript is accepted,
    we will keep the source codes be publicly accessible
        and provide detailed instructions to set up the prototype system.
We will also provide the detailed results of the experimental performance evaluations.

\section*{Ethics Considerations}
This work proposes a privacy-preserving SSO protocol, analyzes its properties of security and privacy,
    implements the prototype system,
    and experimentally evaluates the prototype in isolated settings.
There is no ethical issue.
